// This is a setup file for Jest tests

// 'jest-dom' is a package that provides custom matchers for Jest
// These custom matchers make it easier to assert how your React components are rendered in the Document Object Model (DOM)

// For example, with 'jest-dom' you can do things like:
// expect(element).toHaveTextContent(/react/i)
// This checks if the 'element' contains text that matches the regular expression /react/i

// Learn more about jest-dom at: https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom

// By importing 'jest-dom' here, these custom matchers will be available in all your test files
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
